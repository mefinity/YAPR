I want this server to look more official

so,im gonna suggest some stuff

## Note:
this is probably gonna get updated

# Part 1: Welcome

1.Firstly,change `#welcome` to `#info` or `#rules`

2.Secondly,make a new `#welcome` channel and make it a join log

Howto:
> Server settings > Overview > System Messages Channel

3.i suggest you fix first time joins

- Problem: i suspect that the invite link is made while you're in the `#recipes` channel,this is why for people first time joins they see the `#recipes` channel,so they wont meet the `#info (or #rules)` channel until they explore abit,this is not really professional and makes it more likely that people would break rules cause they havent seen it

- Fix: make an invite that is made in the `#info` channel so people would meet **the law** first time joins,then change the link on websites that you promote the server to

- Howto:
> right click `#info` channel > click invite button

# Part 2: Channels

1.Im going to suggest on categorizing channels

- example:

- Howto:
 > Server settings > Channels > Create category

 > drag and drop channels to categories

2. Rename the categories,like Text channel to general,discussion,talk,chat

3. Removing the redundant voice channel (if its not used much,but im suggesting this cause it doesnt look like its edited

4. Adding useful-links channels to help people like the reddit wiki

5. Making important channel messages into a webhook embed message
by using something like https://discohook.org the messages can be more customizable,plus making it look better overall

# Part ∞: Miscellaneous
other random things i would like to see

1.Profile picture change
i think it would look nice
